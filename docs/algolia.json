External drift kriging and regression kriging, in particular, are fundamental techniques that use spatial autocorrelation and covariate information, i.e. sophisticated regression statistics.\nMachine learning algorithms like random forest have become very popular for spatial environmental prediction.","tags":["rgis","unit01"],"title":"LM | Machine Learning versus spatial statistics","type":"post","url":"/moc-rgis/post/2021-12-10-moc-rgis-unit01-30-lm-machine-learning-versus-spatial-statistics/","weight":0,"wordcount":8902},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":1633824000,"description":"","dir":"","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1633824000,"objectID":"","permalink":"https://gisma-courses.github.io/moc-rgis/post/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/moc-rgis/post/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Posts","type":"post","url":"/moc-rgis/post/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":1633824000,"description":"","dir":"","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1633824000,"objectID":"","permalink":"https://gisma-courses.github.io/moc-rgis/categories/rgis/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/moc-rgis/categories/rgis/","section":"categories","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"rgis","type":"categories","url":"/moc-rgis/categories/rgis/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":1633824000,"description":"","dir":"","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1633824000,"objectID":"","permalink":"https://gisma-courses.github.io/moc-rgis/tags/rgis/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/moc-rgis/tags/rgis/","section":"tags","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"rgis","type":"tags","url":"/moc-rgis/tags/rgis/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"author":null,"categories":["courses","rgis","unit01"],"content":"description","date":1633824000,"description":"description","dir":"post/2021-12-10-moc-rgis-unit01-10-space-needs-a-scope/","excerpt_html":"description","excerpt_text":"description","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":500,"html":"description","keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633824000,"objectID":"2a2dadd8d1ea04d3bb0d8a00664b6e53","permalink":"https://gisma-courses.github.io/moc-rgis/post/2021-12-10-moc-rgis-unit01-10-space-needs-a-scope/","publishdate":"2021-10-10T00:00:00Z","readingtime":3,"relpermalink":"/moc-rgis/post/2021-12-10-moc-rgis-unit01-10-space-needs-a-scope/","section":"post","summary":".myDiv {margin-top: -35px;margin-right: -40%; text-align: right;} Source: Dr. John Snow via wikimedia\n Approaching the topic of spatio-temporal relationships and how to represent them digitally seems problematic for both beginners and experts.
