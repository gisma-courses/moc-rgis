In general, it involves perceiving spatial patterns and interactions in order to arrive at an understanding and description of the underlying processes. This is a scientifically based, abstract, cognitive, spatially focused experience of the world that provides the basis for understanding environmental change, assessing consequences and deriving responses or solutions.","tags":["unit01"],"title":"Space needs a
